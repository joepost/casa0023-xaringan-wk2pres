  abstract = {The present study aims to provide evidence on the effects of pandemic curtailment measures on public health, targeting the changes in breathable air quality, within urban areas. The analyzed period covers the full impact of lockdowns in Europe in 2020. We used everyday data for each analyzed pollutant, NO2, SO2, CO, PM2.5 and PM10, from urban monitoring stations that provided real-time concentrations (provided by Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service, Environmental Protection Agency repository and European Environment Agency map services) and satellite data (provided by NASA Orbiting Carbon Observatory 2). In the present study, the urban air quality was computed using a composite index that was further analyzed in comparison with pandemic restrictions. Descriptive statistics, charts and maps were used to visualize the data that covered the analyzed countries. Our results show that air pollution was reduced by 12\% after lockdowns in European urban areas, with a 0.76 correlation between air pollution and pandemic restrictions. All air pollutants registered significant drops.},

  abstract = {Urban forests have the potential to sink atmospheric CO2. With the improvement of coverage of vegetation in urban environments, more attention has been paid to the carbon sequestration potential of the urban forest. However, the high fragmentation of urban forests makes it difficult to evaluate their carbon budget on a regional scale. In this study, the GPP-NIRv relationship model was employed to estimate GPP in Suzhou by MODIS, Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 remote sensing data, and to further explore what kind of remote images can figure out the spatial-temporal pattern of GPP in urban forests. We found that the total GPP of the terrestrial ecosystem in Suzhou reached 8.43, 8.48, and 9.30 Tg C yr-1 for MODIS, Landsat-8, and Sentinel-2, respectively. Monthly changes of GPP were able to be derived by MODIS and Sentinel-2, with two peaks in April and July. According to Sentinel-2, urban forests accounted for the majority of total GPP, with an average of about 44.63\%, which was larger than the results from GPP products with coarser resolutions. Additionally, it is clear from the high-resolution images that the decline of GPP in May was due to human activities such as the rotation of wheat and rice crops and the pruning of urban forests. Our results improve the understanding of the contribution of the urban forest to the carbon budget and highlight the importance of high-resolution remote sensing images for estimating urban carbon assimilation.},

  abstract = {We present CO2 emission estimates for twenty power plants and related facilities in the United States, India, South Africa, Poland, Russia and South Korea, derived from space-based CO2 observations from NASA's Orbiting Carbon Observatory 2 (OCO-2) satellite. Improvements to OCO-2 data quality and to our methodology yield improved results relative to earlier work. These new results include emission quantification for both larger and smaller power plants, the first power plant emission estimate based on ocean glint data and emissions from a small city with multiple industrial facilities. CO2 emission estimates are compared against reported facility emissions where available, including high temporal resolution data for the eight US sites. The difference with respect to reported values for the US sites ranges from 1.4\% to 26.7\%, with a mean of 15.1\%, although the estimated emission sum for all US sites is within 0.8\% of the reported value, suggesting the errors are largely random. This finding reinforces the importance of revisit rate for future space-based emission monitoring systems and furthermore confirms that making multiple overpasses of a power plant can reduce errors to an accuracy useful to support climate policy. © 2021},
