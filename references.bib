  abstract = {Satellites are an effective source of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) monitoring; however, city-scale monitoring of atmospheric CO2 through space-borne observations is still a challenging task due to the trivial change in atmospheric CO2 concentration compared to its natural variability and background concentration. In this study, we attempted to evaluate the potential of space-based observations to monitor atmospheric CO2 changes at the city scale through simple data-driven analyses. We used the column-averaged dry-air mole fraction of CO2 (XCO2) from the Carbon Observatory 2 (OCO-2) and the anthropogenic CO2 emissions provided by the Open-Data Inventory for Anthropogenic Carbon dioxide (ODIAC) product to explain the scenario of CO2 over 120 districts of Pakistan. To study the anthropogenic CO2 through space-borne observations, XCO2 anomalies (MXCO2) were estimated from OCO-2 retrievals within the spatial boundary of each district, and then the overall spatial distribution pattern of the MXCO2 was analyzed with several datasets including the ODIAC emissions, NO2 tropospheric column, fire locations, cropland, nighttime lights and population density. All the datasets showed a similarity in the spatial distribution pattern. The satellite detected higher CO2 concentrations over the cities located along the China–Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) routes. The CPEC is a large-scale trading partnership between Pakistan and China and large-scale development has been carried out along the CPEC routes over the last decade. Furthermore, the cities were ranked based on mean ODIAC emissions and MXCO2 estimates. The satellite-derived estimates showed a good consistency with the ODIAC emissions at higher values; however, deviations between the two datasets were observed at lower values. To further study the relationship of MXCO2 and ODIAC emissions with each other and with some other datasets such as population density and NO2 tropospheric column, statistical analyses were carried out among the datasets. Strong and significant correlations were observed among all the datasets.},

  abstract = {The present study aims to provide evidence on the effects of pandemic curtailment measures on public health, targeting the changes in breathable air quality, within urban areas. The analyzed period covers the full impact of lockdowns in Europe in 2020. We used everyday data for each analyzed pollutant, NO2, SO2, CO, PM2.5 and PM10, from urban monitoring stations that provided real-time concentrations (provided by Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service, Environmental Protection Agency repository and European Environment Agency map services) and satellite data (provided by NASA Orbiting Carbon Observatory 2). In the present study, the urban air quality was computed using a composite index that was further analyzed in comparison with pandemic restrictions. Descriptive statistics, charts and maps were used to visualize the data that covered the analyzed countries. Our results show that air pollution was reduced by 12\% after lockdowns in European urban areas, with a 0.76 correlation between air pollution and pandemic restrictions. All air pollutants registered significant drops.},

  abstract = {We present CO2 emission estimates for twenty power plants and related facilities in the United States, India, South Africa, Poland, Russia and South Korea, derived from space-based CO2 observations from NASA's Orbiting Carbon Observatory 2 (OCO-2) satellite. Improvements to OCO-2 data quality and to our methodology yield improved results relative to earlier work. These new results include emission quantification for both larger and smaller power plants, the first power plant emission estimate based on ocean glint data and emissions from a small city with multiple industrial facilities. CO2 emission estimates are compared against reported facility emissions where available, including high temporal resolution data for the eight US sites. The difference with respect to reported values for the US sites ranges from 1.4\% to 26.7\%, with a mean of 15.1\%, although the estimated emission sum for all US sites is within 0.8\% of the reported value, suggesting the errors are largely random. This finding reinforces the importance of revisit rate for future space-based emission monitoring systems and furthermore confirms that making multiple overpasses of a power plant can reduce errors to an accuracy useful to support climate policy. © 2021},

  abstract = {Activity reductions in early 2020 due to the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic led to unprecedented decreases in carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Despite their record size, the resulting atmospheric signals are smaller than and obscured by climate variability in atmospheric transport and biospheric fluxes, notably that related to the 2019–2020 Indian Ocean Dipole. Monitoring CO2 anomalies and distinguishing human and climatic causes thus remain a new frontier in Earth system science. We show that the impact of short-term regional changes in fossil fuel emissions on CO2 concentrations was observable from space. Starting in February and continuing through May, column CO2 over many of the world’s largest emitting regions was 0.14 to 0.62 parts per million less than expected in a pandemic-free scenario, consistent with reductions of 3 to 13\% in annual global emissions. Current spaceborne technologies are therefore approaching levels of accuracy and precision needed to support climate mitigation strategies with future missions expected to meet those needs.},
