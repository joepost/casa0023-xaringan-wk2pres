# Summary

OCO-2 stands for **O**rbiting **C**arbon **O**bservatory 2. It was developed by NASA with the objective of providing precise and time-dependent measurements of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), across the globe. 

It is the first satellite designed specifically for studying atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> from space, and therefore also acts to validate the effectiveness of space-based measurement methods `r Citep(myBib, "nasaOrbitingCarbonObservatory22023")`. 

--

The satellite holds three spectrometers:
1.    One spectrometer for observation of atmospheric oxygen, with a spectral range between 758-772nm (Near Infrared)
1.    Two spectrometers for observation of CO<sub>2</sub>; the first with a range between 1594-1619nm, and
1.    the second with a range between 2042-2082nm (Short-wavelength Infrared).

--

The sensors have been designed to observe very specific ranges of the electromagnetic spectrum where Oxygen and CO<sub>2</sub> absorb light `r Citep(myBib, "europeanspaceagencyOCO2OrbitingCarbon2012")`.

# Applications

Why is the OCO-2 important?

-   The standard for atmospheric measurement of CO<sub>2</sub> is through ground-based stations around the world. 
-   However, this leads to large areas of the globe where there is a lack of precise measurement available.
-   Space-based remote sensing through OCO-2 provides global observations at high frequency, precision and spatial resolution `r Citep(myBib, "europeanspaceagencyOCO2OrbitingCarbon2012")`. 

--

How has it been used in research?

-   `r Citet(myBib, "anMonitoringAtmosphericCarbon2022")` have tested the applicability of OCO-2 data to analyse patterns of city-scale CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in Pakistan.
-   `r Citet(myBib, "ciocaEffectsPandemicRestrictions2022")` used OCO-2 data to monitor changes in levels of air pollution in European urban areas following COVID-19 lockdowns.
-   `r Citet(myBib, "nassarAdvancesQuantifyingPower2021")` have compared reported CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from fossil fuel power plants to measurements taken from OCO-2, to estimate reporting error and monitoring gaps.

# So what does it all mean?

# Reflections

-   What you have learnt in relation to the sensor, its use and how the data might be used in future work

-   Talk about learning specific new features (e.g. sun synchronous, pushbroom, spectral range)

--

-   Discovery of useful resources: specifically, the European Space Agency's [**eoPortal**](eoportal.org), which provides an encyclopaedia of resources related to satellites, sensors, earth observation missions.
