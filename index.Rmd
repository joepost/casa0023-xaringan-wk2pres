# Summary

OCO-2 stands for **O**rbiting **C**arbon **O**bservatory 2. It was developed by NASA with the objective of providing precise and time-dependent measurements of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), across the globe. 

It is the first satellite designed specifically for studying atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> from space, and therefore also acts to validate the effectiveness of space-based measurement methods `r Citep(myBib, "nasaOrbitingCarbonObservatory22023")`. 

--

The satellite holds three spectrometers:
1.    One spectrometer for observation of atmospheric oxygen, with a spectral range between 758-772nm
1.    Two spectrometers for observation of CO<sub>2</sub>; the first with a range between 1594-1619nm, and
1.    the second with a range between 2042-2082nm.

# Applications

How has the sentinels data been applied in research?

---

class: inverse, middle, center

# So what does it all mean?
---

# Reflections

-   What you have learnt in relation to the sensor, its use and how the data might be used in future work

-   Talk about learning specific new features (e.g. sun synchronous, pushbroom, spectral range)

--

-   Discovery of useful resources: specifically, the European Space Agency's [**eoPortal**](eoportal.org), which provides an encyclopaedia of resources related to satellites, sensors, earth observation missions.
