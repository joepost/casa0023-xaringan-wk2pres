# Summary

OCO-2 stands for **O**rbiting **C**arbon **O**bservatory 2. It was developed by NASA with the objective of providing precise and time-dependent measurements of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), across the globe. It is the first satellite designed specifically for studying atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> from space, and therefore also acts to validate the effectiveness of space-based measurement methods `r Citep(myBib, "nasaOrbitingCarbonObservatory22023")`. 

--

The satellite holds three spectrometers: One spectrometer for observation of atmospheric oxygen, in the Near Infrared band, and two spectrometers for observation of CO<sub>2</sub>, in the Short-wavelength Infrared band.The sensors have been designed to observe very specific ranges of the electromagnetic spectrum where Oxygen and CO<sub>2</sub> absorb light `r Citep(myBib, "europeanspaceagencyOCO2OrbitingCarbon2012")`.

# Applications

Why is the OCO-2 important?

-   The standard for atmospheric measurement of CO<sub>2</sub> is through ground-based stations around the world. 
-   However, this leads to large areas of the globe where there is a lack of precise measurement available.
-   Space-based remote sensing through OCO-2 provides global observations at high frequency, precision and spatial resolution `r Citep(myBib, "europeanspaceagencyOCO2OrbitingCarbon2012")`. 

--

How has it been used?

-   Emissions data from the OCO-2 are open access, for the entire span of the mission (September 2014 onwards), from NASA's [GES DISC](https://disc.gsfc.nasa.gov/datasets?keywords=OCO-2%20v10r&page=1) repository. The data has been pre-processed and corrected. 

-   In 2022 `r Citet(myBib, "weirRegionalImpactsCOVID192021", .opts = list(max.names=3, longnamesfirst=FALSE))` published research that identified  _short-term_, _regional_ changes in atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>, attributable to human activities. The research combined the high frequency OCO-2 CO<sub>2</sub> data with data and analysis from another NASA tool - the Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS).

# Applications

How has it been used in urban/cities research?

-   `r Citet(myBib, "anMonitoringAtmosphericCarbon2022", .opts = list(max.names=3, longnamesfirst=FALSE))` have tested the applicability of OCO-2 data to analyse patterns of city-scale CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in Pakistan.
-   `r Citet(myBib, "ciocaEffectsPandemicRestrictions2022")` used OCO-2 data to monitor changes in levels of air pollution in European urban areas following COVID-19 lockdowns.
-   `r Citet(myBib, "nassarAdvancesQuantifyingPower2021", .opts = list(max.names=3, longnamesfirst=FALSE))` have compared reported CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from fossil fuel power plants to measurements taken from OCO-2, to estimate reporting error and monitoring gaps.

# So what does it all mean?

# Reflections

Investigating the OCO-2 has been an opportunity to learn more in-depth about the features of satellites and remote sensing principles. 

Points of interest: 
-   The variety in purpose and capability of different remote sensors. The OCO-2 is one of a suite of NASA satellites released as part of a Climate Continuity Mission, which are designed for the observation of atmospheric gases, clouds, and pollutants - as opposed to the terrestrial surface. 

--

-   The importance of a satellite's orbit; for example, how a **sun-synchronised orbit (SSO)** means that a satellite always passes over a point on the globe at the same time of day, which allows for meaningful comparisons of change over time.

--

-   Discovery of useful resources - specifically, the European Space Agency's [**eoPortal**](eoportal.org), which provides an encyclopaedia of resources related to satellites, sensors, and earth observation missions.

# Reflections


How could the data be used in future work? 

-   As discussed in the **Applications** section, OCO-2 has been used at the city-scale level to track regional emissions patterns, monitoring of power plants, and to assess air pollution for public health. For my own work, I would be interested in researching further how the data can be applied in a climate and health context. It would also be good to explore further the remote sensing data available in the GES DISC repository.
